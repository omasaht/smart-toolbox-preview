## Smart Toolbox Application

This was my first major project done on GUI development. This application ran on an embedded device and was targeted to Linux platform. The most challenging part to me in this project was to build a real time application that is able to process Computer Vision algorithm, GUI rendering, and Video recording at 30 fps. I used Kivy which is a cross-platform and open-source framework for Graphics User Interface and User Design Application. 

### Video

The following attached video highlights some of the key features that I had to integrate in this application.
