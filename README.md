## Smart Toolbox Application

This was my first major project done on GUI development. This application ran on an embedded device and was targeted to Linux platform. The most challenging part to me in this project was to build a real time application that is able to process Computer Vision algorithm, GUI rendering, and Video recording at 30 fps. I used Kivy which is a cross-platform and open-source framework for Graphics User Interface and User Design Application. 

### GUI Development

The video attached below highlights some of the key features that I had to integrate in this application.

### Disclaimer

The demo application shown above only presents the initial phase of the toolbox project on which I worked on at Insight Corporation. It is in no way a final production ready application version and does not represent the company's product itself. The purpose of this page is to highlight and share my development work.
